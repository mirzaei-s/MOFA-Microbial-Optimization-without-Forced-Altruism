# MOFA: Microbial Optimization without Forced Altruism 
A nonlinear programming method for analyzing microbial community-level growth rate without enforced altruism.
This repository contains a Python implementation of MOFA (Microbial Optimization without Forced Altruism) applied to microbial communities.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to model and optimize the growth of microbial communities by merging individual species' metabolic networks and applying nonlinear optimization to predict community behavior. MOFA allows the study of microbial interactions without imposing artificial constraints on altruistic behavior.
